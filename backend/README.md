To make a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv /root/.virtualenvs/-todo-fastapi-


To activate venv: 

    source /root/.virtualenvs/-todo-fastapi-/bin/activate


To start: 

    [nohup] python3 main.py
    


  
Mention: 

Backend service is running on port 10086. And virtual environment is on remote, and debugging has to be under the remote project directory(using mapping)
